# Full Stack Frameworks with Django [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/STEPLADD3R/full-stack-frameworks-with-django.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/STEPLADD3R/full-stack-frameworks-with-django)
## By Stuart Green 

### Project Overview
I was tasked with creating one of three things, I decided to go with the issue tracker as funnily enough it fits right in with a gap that I have at work currently (the lack of a way to properly track/manage bug fixes). The goal of this project was to allow users to submit bugs / feature requests to the developers of the Unicorn Attractor application whilst utilising technologies such as Django and Stripe.

### User Stories
As the website admin / owner, I want to be able to see what bugs users have found when using the Unicorn Attractor application so that I can get the issues fixed and users will continue to enjoy the Unicorn Attractor app. As well as this, it would be nice to earn some extra income by allowing users to submit Feature Requests that will not only fund us, but bring a better user experience to the end user.

As a user of the site, I would like to be able to notify the creators of Unicorn Attractor of issues I've encountered when using the website so that they can get fixed, and my experience will be better. Since I've used the application so much, I think that I could also provide some feedback to the developers so that they can implement quality of life features to help better the app.

### UX
Details of the UX design process is available inside the 'project-supplements/user-experience' directory. This directory contains an array of documents that illustrate the UX design process in the form of wireframes.

### Database
Details of the Database design process is available inside the 'project-supplements/database-design' directory. This directory contains an array of documnents that illustrate how I came to decide on the database collections and fields.

### Technologies
Here's a list of technologies used:

1. HTML5 - Used for marking up the DOM.
2. SCSS (CSS Pre Processor) - Used to create the styling.
3. jQuery - Used to provide some neat functionalities such as accordions, toast notifications and more.
4. NPM - Used to pull in packages, such as Bootstrap so that I could control the SCSS more easily.
5. Git - Used to handle version control
6. Python & Django - Python Framework to handle config, routes and more.
7. MySQL - Database of choice

### Testing
Details of the project testing process is available inside the 'project-supplements/testing' directory.
